At Astrah OS, privacy is not a checkbox — it is a system principle. It is embedded into how the platform is
designed, operated, and governed. This Privacy Policy explains in detail how we collect, use, store, process,
and protect information when you interact with Astrah OS, our website, and our related services.

We believe enterprise systems should operate with clarity and restraint. That means collecting only what is
necessary, using it with intent, and protecting it with rigor. This policy reflects that philosophy and outlines
our responsibilities and your rights.

This policy applies to all visitors, users, customers, partners, and authorized representatives who access or
interact with Astrah OS through any interface, deployment model, or communication channel.

We encourage you to read this policy carefully to understand how information flows through the Astrah OS
ecosystem and how we safeguard trust at every layer.

## Introduction

Astrah OS is built to help enterprises manage revenue systems, not personal lives. The platform is
intentionally designed to minimize personal data exposure while still delivering operational intelligence and
system reliability.

We collect information only where it is required to operate the platform, secure customer environments,
support users, and meet legal or contractual obligations. We do not sell personal data, trade it, or use it for
unrelated commercial purposes.

Privacy at Astrah OS is aligned with system integrity. By using Astrah OS, you acknowledge and agree to the
practices described in this Privacy Policy, which are designed to balance functionality, security, and user
control.

## Information We Collect

We collect information in clearly defined and limited categories to ensure transparency and proportional
use.

**Information you provide directly**

This includes basic identification and account-related information such as your name, work email,
organization details, credentials, configuration inputs, and any information you choose to share when
contacting support or providing feedback.

**Information collected automatically**

When you interact with Astrah OS, certain technical information is collected automatically to ensure security
and system stability. This may include device and browser details, IP address, approximate location, and
session-related metadata required for authentication and protection.

**System-generated and operational data**

As part of normal operation, Astrah OS generates internal metadata such as logs, audit trails, and workflow-
related signals. This information supports reliability, governance, compliance, and enterprise oversight.

We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal data such as biometric information, personal financial
details, or private communications unless explicitly required by law, regulation, or a signed enterprise
agreement.

## How We Use Your Information

Information collected by Astrah OS is used strictly for legitimate operational purposes. This includes
operating and maintaining the platform, securing access, monitoring system health, supporting users,
communicating service updates, and meeting legal or contractual obligations.

We do not use collected data for targeted advertising, behavioral profiling, or resale. Any analytics
performed are system-focused and intended solely to improve reliability, scalability, and user experience
within the platform.

## Data Storage and Security

Astrah OS applies enterprise-grade security practices suitable for regulated and high-trust environments.
Security is treated as a continuous system process rather than a static feature.

Protective measures are applied across the system and include encryption of data at rest and in transit,
strong access controls with role-based permissions, segmentation between customer environments, and
continuous monitoring and audit logging.

Infrastructure is hosted in secure cloud environments within defined geographic regions. Data access is
limited to authorized personnel who require it for operational, support, or compliance purposes, and all
access is logged and reviewed.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

Astrah OS does not sell, rent, or trade personal or customer data.

Information may be shared only under limited circumstances. These include operating core infrastructure
services, complying with legal obligations, honoring explicit customer authorization, or protecting the
security and integrity of Astrah OS and its users.

All third-party processors are vetted and contractually obligated to maintain confidentiality, security, and
data protection standards consistent with this Privacy Policy.

## Data Retention

We retain information only for as long as it is reasonably necessary to provide and support Astrah OS, fulfill
contractual and service obligations, comply with legal or regulatory requirements, and resolve disputes or
enforce platform agreements.

Retention periods may vary depending on data type and customer configuration. When information is no
longer required, it is securely deleted, anonymized, or archived in accordance with industry-recognized best
practices.

## Your Rights and Controls

Depending on your jurisdiction and contractual relationship with Astrah OS, you may have certain rights
regarding your information. These may include the ability to access, correct, delete, restrict, or request
portability of personal data, subject to legal and operational limitations. held by the system - Request
correction of inaccurate or outdated information - Request deletion where legally and operationally
permissible - Object to or restrict specific processing activities - Request export or portability of certain data

Requests may be submitted through official Astrah OS support channels. We verify requests before
processing and respond within reasonable and legally defined timeframes.

## Cookies and Tracking

Astrah OS uses a limited set of cookies and similar technologies strictly necessary for system operation.
These support authentication, session continuity, security controls, abuse prevention, and basic
performance measurement.

We do not deploy third-party advertising cookies, cross-site tracking tools, or behavioral monitoring
technologies. Optional cookies, where applicable, are clearly disclosed.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in system functionality, legal requirements,
or operational practices. Updates are made with the goal of maintaining clarity and trust.

Material changes will be communicated through the Astrah OS website or platform interface. Continued
use of the services after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Contact

If you have questions, concerns, or requests related to privacy or data protection, you may contact us
through official Astrah OS communication channels.

We believe trust is built through systems that respect boundaries — this policy is part of that commitment.
