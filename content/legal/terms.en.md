At Astrah OS, we believe that clear agreements are the foundation of reliable systems. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of Astrah OS. By accessing or using our platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

We view this agreement not merely as a legal requirement, but as a mutual commitment to operational integrity, security, and professional conduct.

## Access and License

Astrah OS grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use the platform solely for your internal business operations. This license is conditioned on your compliance with these Terms and our Acceptable Use Policy.

You acknowledge that Astrah OS retains all ownership, intellectual property rights, and interest in the platform, including its code, architecture, and design.

## User Responsibilities

Trust is a shared responsibility. As a user, you agree to:

- Maintain the confidentiality of your credentials.
- Ensure that all information provided to us is accurate and current.
- Use the platform only for lawful purposes and in accordance with all applicable regulations.
- Assume responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or environment.

## Service Availability and SLAs

We design Astrah OS for high availability and resilience. However, unless explicitly defined in a separate Service Level Agreement (SLA), the platform is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. While we strive for seamless operation, we do not guarantee that the service will be uninterrupted or error-free at all times.

## Intellectual Property

Your data remains yours. Astrah OS claims no ownership over the business data, files, or content you upload to the system.

Conversely, the Astrah OS infrastructure, algorithms, interfaces, and documentation remain the exclusive property of Astrah OS. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to derive the source code of the platform.

## Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Astrah OS shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of profits, data, or business continuity, arising out of or related to your use of the platform.

Our liability is limited to the direct damages actually incurred, capped at the fees paid by you for the service during the twelve (12) months preceding the incident.

## Termination

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to Astrah OS if we detect a violation of these Terms, the Acceptable Use Policy, or if required by law. You may terminate your use of the service at any time, subject to the terms of your specific subscription agreement.

## Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms to reflect changes in our system or legal landscape. We will provide notice of material changes. Continued use of Astrah OS following such updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
