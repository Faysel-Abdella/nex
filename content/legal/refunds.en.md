**Effective Date: 28-01-2026**

This Refunds & Cancellations Policy explains how cancellations, refunds, and billing disputes are handled for **Astrah OS**. This policy applies unless superseded by a separate written agreement (such as an Order Form, MSA, or Enterprise SLA).

---

## Cancellations

- You may cancel your **Astrah OS** subscription at any time.
- Your subscription will remain active until the end of your current paid billing period (monthly or annual).
- After the billing period ends, your subscription will not renew and you will not be charged again unless you re-subscribe.

---

## Refunds (Default Rule)

- All subscription fees are non-refundable by default.
- This includes cases where you stop using the Service before the end of the billing period.
- **Astrah OS** does not provide pro-rated refunds or credits for unused time unless required by applicable law or explicitly stated in a separate written agreement.

---

## Billing Errors

If you believe you were charged incorrectly (for example, duplicate charges or wrong plan billing), contact us within **30 days** of the charge.

We may issue a refund or credit only where:

- A billing error occurred on our side, or
- A charge was demonstrably unauthorized or incorrect

---

## Service Credits

**(Enterprise Only, If an SLA Exists)**

If your subscription includes a separate written Service Level Agreement (SLA) and **Astrah OS** fails to meet the SLA commitments, you may be eligible for service credits as defined in that SLA.

- Credits apply to future billing cycles only.
- Credits are not cash refunds.

If you do not have an SLA, this section does not apply.

---

## Chargebacks and Payment Disputes

Before initiating a chargeback, you agree to contact **Astrah OS** support to attempt resolution.

Unjustified chargebacks may result in:

- Immediate suspension of the Workspace or Account, and/or
- Restriction from future use of **Astrah OS**
