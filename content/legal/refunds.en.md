At Astrah OS, commercial fairness is our baseline. We aim to provide a transparent and predictable billing experience. This policy outlines the circumstances under which refunds or credits may be issued.

As an enterprise platform, our relationships are governed by contracts and service agreements. The terms below apply unless superseded by a specific master services agreement.

## Subscription Services

Astrah OS is generally billed on a subscription basis (monthly or annually).

- **Non-Refundable by Default:** Payments for subscription periods are generally non-refundable, including cases where you choose to stop using the service before the end of the current billing cycle.
- **Cancellations:** You may cancel your subscription at any time. Your access will continue until the end of the current billing period, after which no further charges will be applied.

## Service Level Agreement (SLA) Credits

We stand behind our system reliability. If Astrah OS fails to meet the uptime or performance guarantees defined in your Service Level Agreement (SLA), you may be eligible for service credits.

- Credits are calculated based on the downtime duration and the terms of your specific SLA.
- Credits are applied to future billing cycles and are not issued as cash refunds.

## Exceptional Circumstances

We review refund requests related to billing errors or system malfunctions on a case-by-case basis. If you believe you were charged incorrectly or if the service was fundamentally inaccessible due to a failure on our part:

1.  Contact support within 30 days of the disputed charge.
2.  Provide documentation of the issue.

We reserve the right to deny refund requests that fall outside of our SLA terms or are the result of user configuration errors.

## Dispute Resolution

We encourage customers to contact our support team to resolve billing issues before initiating chargebacks. Unjustified chargebacks may result in the suspension of your account and a ban from future use of Astrah OS services.
