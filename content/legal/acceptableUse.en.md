Astrah OS is a shared ecosystem designed for enterprise reliability. The integrity of the platform depends on the responsible actions of every participant. This Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") defines the boundaries of permissible activity within our environment.

We believe in preventing abuse before it disrupts operations. This policy applies to all users, customers, and entities interacting with Astrah OS.

## Prohibited Activities

**Engage in Illegal or Harmful Conduct**

- Facilitate illegal activities, fraud, or violations of applicable laws.

- Engage in phishing, spamming, or mass unsolicited messaging.

**Abuse Resources**

- Use the platform for cryptocurrency mining or other excessive computational tasks unrelated to the intended service.

- Copy, modify, or create derivative works of Astrah OS.
- Use the platform to build a competitive product or service.
